# Linear-Algebra-Python-Homework
Homework from Linear Algebra Class Using Python and Numpy. Most of the code is working, but some may not be.
I created this repository to hold on to some of my older code.
This code was mostly written for problems in the book: Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python 3 Edition 3.
